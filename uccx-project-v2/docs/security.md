## Security and Access Configuration:

### PostgreSQL Security Configuration
Issue the below query on PostgreSQL to create the Metabase role and grant it the required access. The role's access to PostgreSQL is reviewed yearly:

    ```
    BEGIN;
    CREATE ROLE your_role_name WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'your_role_pwd' VALID UNTIL '2027-01-01';
    GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE uccx TO your_role_name;
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA uccxmodels_marts TO your_role_name;
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA uccxmodels_marts TO your_role_name;
    GRANT SELECT, USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA uccxmodels_marts TO your_role_name;
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA uccxmodels_marts 
    GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO your_role_name;
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA uccxmodels_marts 
    GRANT SELECT, USAGE ON SEQUENCES TO your_role_name;
    COMMIT;
    ```
